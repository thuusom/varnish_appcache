        <h1>Varnish authentication example</h1>
        <p>
            This is an example of how varnish can be configured to call an authentication
            url on requests that are to be secure and still cachable. 
        </p>
        <h2>Authentication calls</h2>
        <p>
            The authentication request is just /authentication.html which always returns 200. 
            The protected but cachable resource is <a href="secure.html">secure</a> and in the access log you should
            see a call to authentication.html every time there is a call to secure.html, but the response
            isn't cached.
        </p>
        <h2>Authenticated calls - cached</h2>
        <p>
            The calls to <a href="secure_cached.html">Secure Cached</a> is doing the same as above, but the response is cached which you 
            should see on the x-cache header in the response.
        </p>
        <h2>Unauthenticated calls cached and not cached</h2>
        <p>
            This is standard varnish, but calls to <a href="unsecure.html">Unsecure</a> are not cached and <a href="unsecure_cached.html">Unsecure cached</a> are 
            cached. Both are not requirering authentication calls.
        </p>
        <h2>Note!</h2>
        <p> 
            When accessing this directly in nginx all requests are uncached and unsecure!
        </p>
